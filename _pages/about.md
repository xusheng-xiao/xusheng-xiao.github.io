Xusheng Xiao is an Associate Professor in the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). His general research interests span between **software engineering** and **computer security**, with the focus on developing advanced analysis techniques to analyze complex software behaviors for improving the reliability and the security of complex software and systems. He is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. Specifically, his RISE lab is working on the research in mobile app analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, blockchain and smart contract security, automated software testing, program analysis, and bug detection. 

His research in cyber threat investigation has been integrated into a security product in NEC, which won the Grand Prix award at CEATEC Award 2016. His research in mobile app security produced a static analysis technique that was deployed in Microsoft Research for two years and was granted a US patent. His collaboration with industry partners has resulted in [6 US patents](/publications/#patent). He got his his Ph.D. in 2014 and has worked as a researcher in [NEC Labs America](https://www.nec-labs.com/) for two years. From Feb 2017 to August 2022, he was an Assitant Professor in the [Department of Computer and Data Sciences](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences) at [Case Western Reserve University](www.case.edu) (CWRU). He is a recipient of NSF CAREER Award, NSF CRII Award, Samsung GRO Award, and the Case School of Engineering Faculty Research Award at CWRU. His research has been supported by NSF, DOE-ARPA-E, and Samsung.
