Dr. Xusheng Xiao is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. His general research interests span between **software engineering** and **computer security**, with the focus on developing advanced analysis techniques to analyze complex software behaviors for improving the reliability and the security of complex software and systems. Specifically, his lab is working on the research in mobile app analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, blockchain and smart contract security, automated software testing, program analysis, and bug detection. His research in cyber threat investigation has been integrated into a [security product](https://www.nec.com/en/global/techrep/journal/g16/n01/160110.html) in NEC, which won the [Grand Prix award at CEATEC Award 2016](http://archive.ceatec.com/2016/en/award/award01_02.html#awtown). His research in mobile app security produced a static analysis technique that was deployed in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/touchdevelop/) for two years and was granted a US patent. His collaboration with industry partners has resulted in [6 US patents](/publications/#patent).
