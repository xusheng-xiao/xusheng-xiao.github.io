Dr. Xusheng Xiao is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. His general research interests span between **software engineering** and **computer security**, with the emphasis on **AI-enhanced software and system analysis approaches** that synergistically combine software analysis and artificial intelligence to improve the reliability and the security of software and computer systems. Specifically, his lab is working on the research in _Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced software analysis, mobile app analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, blockchain/smart contract security, and software testing and debugging_. His research in cyber threat investigation has been integrated into a [security product](https://www.nec.com/en/global/techrep/journal/g16/n01/160110.html) in NEC, which won the [Grand Prix award at CEATEC Award 2016](http://archive.ceatec.com/2016/en/award/award01_02.html#awtown). His lab developed [HyperService](https://github.com/HyperService-Consortium), the first interoperability blockchain platform with programmability and strong security guarantees, presented in [IEEE Blockchain Cleveland](http://www.clevelandieee.org/events/hyperservice-interoperability-and-programmability-across-heterogeneous-blockchains) and [Blockland Solutions Conference](https://www.blocklandsolutions.com/page/1435903/speakers). His research in mobile app security produced a static analysis technique that was deployed in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/touchdevelop/) for two years and was granted a US patent. His collaboration with industry partners has resulted in [6 US patents](/publications/#patent).
