Dr. Xusheng Xiao is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. His general research interests span between **software engineering** and **computer security**, with the focus on developing advanced analysis techniques to analyze complex software behaviors for improving the reliability and the security of complex software and systems. Specifically, his lab is working on the research in mobile app analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, blockchain/smart contract security, and software testing and debugging. His research in cyber threat investigation has been integrated into a [security product](https://www.nec.com/en/global/techrep/journal/g16/n01/160110.html) in NEC, which won the [Grand Prix award at CEATEC Award 2016](http://archive.ceatec.com/2016/en/award/award01_02.html#awtown). His lab developed [HyperService](https://github.com/HyperService-Consortium), the first interoperability blockchain platform with programmability and strong security guarantees, presented in [IEEE Blockchain Cleveland](http://www.clevelandieee.org/events/hyperservice-interoperability-and-programmability-across-heterogeneous-blockchains) and [Blockland Solutions Conference](https://www.blocklandsolutions.com/page/1435903/speakers). His research in mobile app security produced a static analysis technique that was deployed in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/touchdevelop/) for two years and was granted a US patent. His collaboration with industry partners has resulted in [6 US patents](/publications/#patent).
