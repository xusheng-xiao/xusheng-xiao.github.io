**PhD Positions in Software Engineering and Computer Security**

Dr. Xusheng Xiao is looking for self-motivated PhD students with strong academic backgrounds in Software Engineering, Computer Security, or Machine Learning. Potential research projects include, but are not limited to: mobile app security, Virtual Reality (VR) app security, system-auditing log analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, smart contract security, as well as the synergy between Program Analysis/Software Testing/Debugging and AI. Please include a copy of your detailed CV/Resume (with your prior research experience) in your email sent to xusheng.xiao@asu.edu, and [apply](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-admissions/) to [ASU SCAI](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) (with your "Faculty Interest") by **Dec. 31st**!

Dr. Xiao is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. His lab focuses on three research directions: (1) *Software Testing and Analysis*: developing novel program analysis techniques, machine learning techniques, and text analysis techniques to automatically detect undesired behaviors of software applications and generate test inputs to explore software behaviors; (2) *Cyber Threat Detection and Investigation*: developing causality analysis techniques, domain- specific languages, and data summarization techniques to analyze system auditing logs for revealing attack contextual information; (3) *Blockchain System and Smart Contract Security*: developing secure platform to support interoperability of blockchain systems and program analysis techniques to fix smart contract vulnerabilities and synthesize smart contracts from natural-language documents. His research results are consistently published in top-tier venues in Software Engineering (ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA), Computer Security (IEEE S&P, CCS, USENIX Security), and Database (ICDE, VLDB).
